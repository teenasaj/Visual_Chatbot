# Visual-Chatbot

An AllenNLP integrated Visual chatbot to classify tourist places in India.

Here's a visual bot which can help you find more about the monuments of India.

Our Project is to build a visual chatbot which can classify 40 different places using Neural Networks and help you to get to know more about the place with the chatbot. In particular we have used the AlexNet.

AlexNet is a Convolutional Neural Network that rose to prominence when it won the Imagenet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC), which is an annual challenge that evaluates algorithms for object detection and image classification at large scale (think of it as the World cup for image classification algorithms).
